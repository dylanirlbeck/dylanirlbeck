_Hey, I'm Dylan!_ ðŸ‘‹

A little about me: I'm currently a senior at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), studying computer science. Over the last couple years I have done some open-source
work, interned at
a [few](https://flexport.com) [different](https://draftbit.com)
[companies](https://relativity.com), and collaborated with a [couple](https://pritzker.uchicago.edu/) [other](https://www.artic.edu/) organizations, doing (what I believe to be) impactful work.

I'm presently interested in two overlapping fields: the philosophy of technology and the intersection of technology and the public sector.
I also try to cook decent vegetarian food from the NYT Cooking app, explore the
city of Chicago, and read a good book every once in a while (currently [_Caste_](https://www.isabelwilkerson.com/), recently [_A Civic Technologist's Practice Guide_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55225556-a-civic-technologist-s-practice-guide)).
I'm always looking to meet new people, so do [drop me a line](mailto:dylanirlbeck@gmail.com) if
you'd like to chat.

Cheers!
