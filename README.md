_Hey, I'm Dylan!_ ðŸ‘‹

A little about me: I'm a recent graduate from the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I studied computer science. This summer, I'll be working with the General Services Administration as a [Civic Digital Fellow](https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship). Over the last couple years I have done some open-source
work, interned at
a [few](https://flexport.com) [different](https://draftbit.com)
[companies](https://relativity.com), and collaborated with a [couple](https://pritzker.uchicago.edu/) [other](https://www.artic.edu/) organizations, doing (what I believe to be) impactful work.

My present interests include the intersection of digital technology and society, computing ethics, and the philosophy of science and technology.
I also try to cook decent vegetarian food from NYT Cooking, explore the
city of Chicago, and read a good book every so often (currently [A New Guide to Better Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1390913.A_New_Guide_to_Better_Writing)).

I'm always looking to meet new people, so do [drop me a line](mailto:dylanirlbeck@gmail.com) if
you'd like to chat.
