_Hey, I'm Dylan!_ ðŸ‘‹

A little about me: I'm currently a senior at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), studying computer science. Over the last couple years I have done some open-source
work, interned at
a [few](https://flexport.com) [different](https://draftbit.com)
[companies](https://relativity.com), and collaborated with a [couple](https://pritzker.uchicago.edu/) [other](https://www.artic.edu/) organizations, doing (what I believe to be) impactful work.

My present interests include the intersection of digital technology and society, computing ethics, and the philosophy of science and technology.
I also try to cook decent vegetarian food from NYT Cooking, explore the
city of Chicago, and read a good book every so often (currently [Algorithms of Oppression](http://algorithmsofoppression.com/) by Safiya Noble).

I'm always looking to meet new people, so do [drop me a line](mailto:dylanirlbeck@gmail.com) if
you'd like to chat.
