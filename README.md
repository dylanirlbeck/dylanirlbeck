_Hey, I'm Dylan!_ :wave

A little about me: I'm currently a senior at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), studying computer science. I have done some open-source
work over the last couple years, have given a few talks, and met people -- both
in person and virtually -- from all over the world. I have also interned at
a [few](https://flexport.com) [different](https://draftbit.com)
[companies](https://relativity.com) doing (what I believe to be) impactful work.

I'm presently interested in two overlapping fields: software as a tool for
positive social change and the intersection of technology and public policy.
I also try to cook decent vegetarian food from the NYT Cooking app, explore the
city of Chicago, and read a good book every once in a while (currently [_A Civic
Technologist's Practice Guide_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781735286501)).
I'm always looking to meet other interesting humans, so do drop me a line if
you'd like to chat.

Cheers!
